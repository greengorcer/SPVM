=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<SPVM::Document::LanguageSpecification> describes SPVM language specification.

=head1 Tokenization

Describes the tokenizing of the SPVM language.

=head2 Character Set

SPVM language are written by UTF-8.

=head2 Line Terminators

Line terminators are C<LF>, C<CR>, and C<CRLF> of ASCII.

When a line terminator appears, the current line number is incremented. The line terminator is converted to C<LF> of ASCII .

=head2 Space Characters

Space characters are C<SP>, C<HT>, C<FF> of ASCII and L<"Line Terminators">.

Space characters have no meaning in programs.

=head2 Identifiers

Identifiers are L<"Class Names">, L<"Method Names">, L<"Field Names">, L<"Class Variable Names">, and L<"Local Variable Names">.

=head2 Class Names

A class names consists of one or more alphabet(C<a-zA-Z>), number(C<0-9>), underscore(C<_>) or C<::> of ASCII.

The part names of a class name must start uppercase letter. Part names means, for example, "Foo", "Bar", and "Baz" in the class name "Foo:Bar::Baz".

C<::> cannot be continued twice. The last character cannot end with C<::>.

Underscore C<_> cannot be continued twice.

A class name must be corresponding to the relative name of the module file. If the class name is "Foo::Bar::Baz", the relative name of the module file must be "Foo/Bar/Baz.spvm".

If class names are invalid, a compilation error occurs.

B<Examples of valid class names:>

  Foo
  Foo::Bar

  # Valid field names
  FOO
  FOO_BAR3
  foo
  foo_bar
  _foo
  _foo_bar_

  3foo

A field name can be the same as L<"Keywords">.
  
  # "if" is a valid field name although this name is the same as the "if" keyword.
  has if : int;

=head2 Class Variable Names

A class variable name starts with C<$>, followed alphabets(C<a-zA-Z>), numbers(C<0-9>), underscores(C<_>) or C<::> of ASCII.

The followed character must not start with a number.

C<::> cannot be continued twice. Last characters cannot end with C<::>.

Underscore(C<_>) cannot be continued twice.

If class variable names are invalid, a compilation error occurs.

B<Examples of valid class variable names:>

  # Valid class variable names
  $FOO::BAR
  $Foo::Bar3
  $FOO
  $FOO_BAR
  $foo

B<Examples of invalid class variable names:>
  
  # Invalid class variable names
  $FOO__BAR
  $3FOO

=head2 Local Variable Names

A local variable name starts with C<$>, followed alphabets(C<a-zA-Z>), numbers(C<0-9>), underscores(C<_>) of ASCII.

The followed character must not start with a number.

Underscore(C<_>) cannot be continued twice.

If local variable names are invalid, a compilation error occurs.

B<Examples of valid local variable names:>

  # Valid local variable names
  $foo
  $foo_bar3
  $_foo
  $FOO

=head2 Comments

A comment begins with "#" and ends with L<"Line Terminators">.

  # Comment

Comments have no meaning in tokenization.

=head2 POD

POD(Plain Old Document) is a syntax to write documents easily.

  "\N{U+3042}\N{U+3044}\N{U+3046}"

=head2 Bool Literal

The bool literal is a L<literal|"Literals"> to represent a bool value in source codes.

=head3 true

C<true> is the alias for L<The TRUE method of the Bool module|SPVM::Bool/"TRUE">.

  true

B<Examples of true:>

  # true
  my $is_valid = true;

=head3 false

C<false> is the alias for L<The FALSE method of the Bool module|SPVM::Bool/"FALSE">.

  false

B<Examples of false:>

  # false
  my $is_valid = false;

=head2 Variable Expansion

B<Variable Expansion> applys L<"Local Variable">, L<"Class Variable">, L<"Dereference">, L<"Field Access">, L<"Array Access">, L<"Exception Variable"> in String Literal.

  "AAA $foo BBB"
  "AAA $FOO BBB"
  "AAA $$foo BBB"
  "AAA $foo->{x} BBB"
  "AAA $foo->[3] BBB"
  "AAA $foo->{x}[3] BBB"
  "AAA $@ BBB"

The above is expanded as the following.

  "AAA" . $foo . "BBB"
  "AAA" . $FOO . "BBB"
  "AAA" . $$foo . "BBB"
  "AAA" . $foo->{x} . "BBB"
  "AAA" . $foo->[3] . "BBB"
  "AAA" . $foo->{x}[3] . "BBB"
  "AAA" . $@ . "BBB"

The variable name can besurround with "{" and "}" to indicate the end of the variable name.

  "AAA ${foo}_ccc BBB"

The above is expanded as the following.

  "AAA " . ${foo} . "_ccc BBB"

If there is no enclosing "{" and "}", up to the valid part as a variable name is interpreted as a Variable. Dereference interpreting is same as this.

If "->" follows the variable name, it is interpreted as L<"Field Access"> or L<"Array Access">.

[1] If the following Characters are "a-z" "A-Z" "0-9" "_" "{" "[", proceed with the interpretation.

[2] If the Character following [1] is "}", or "]", then if the next Character is "->", "{", or "[", proceed with the interpretation and return back to [1], otherwise stop interpreting.

The trailing $is not treated as the start of Variable Expansion. It is treated as "$".

  "AAA$"

=head1 Class

Descriptions of classes.

=head2 Class Definition

The C<class> keyword defins a class. A class has a class block.

  class CLASS_NAME {
  
  }

Class names must follow the rule of L<class names|"Class Names">.

L<Class descriptors|"Class Descriptors"> can be specified after C<:>.

  class CLASS_NAME : CLASS_DESCRIPTOR {
  
  }
  
  class CLASS_NAME : CLASS_DESCRIPTOR1 CLASS_DESCRIPTOR2 ... CLASS_DESCRIPTORN {
  
  }

B<Examples of class definitions:>

  # The definition of a class
  class Point {
  
  }

  # With class descriptors
  class Point : public {
  
  }

Direct children of the class block must be L<use|"Load Modules">, L<our|"Class Variable">,
L<has|"Field Definition">, L<enum|"Enumeration Definition">, L<method|"Method Definition">, L<allow|"Allow Class Access">,
L<implement|"implement Statement"> and L<INIT block|"INIT Block"> can be defined.

  class Foo {
 
    use Point;
  
    our $VAR : int;
  
    has var : int;
  
    enum {
      CONST_VAL1,
      CONST_VAL2,
    }
  
    static method foo : int ($num : int) {
      # ...
    }

    implement Asset;
    
    INIT {
      # ...
    }
  }

If more than one class in a module file, a compilation error occurs.

If the class name is different from the name that the module file C</> is replaced with C<::> and added C<.spvm> to the end, a compilation error occurs.

  # Valid class name for "Foo/Bar/Baz.spvm"
  class Foo::Bar::Baz {
    
  }

  # Invalid class name for "Foo/Bar/Baz.spvm"
  class Foo::Bar::Hello {
    
  }
  
=head2 Class Descriptors

The list of class descriptors.

=begin html

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>
      Descriptors
   </th>
    <th>
      Meaning
   </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <b>public</b>
    </td>
    <td>
      This class is public. Other classes can new the object from this class.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <b>private</b>
    </td>
    <td>
      This class is private. Other classes can't new the object from this class. This is default setting.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <b>callback_t</b>
    </td>
    <td>
      This class is a <a href="#Callback-Type">callback type</a>.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <b>interface_t</b>
    </td>
    <td>
      This class is an <a href="#Interface-Type">interface type</a>.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <b>mulnum_t</b>
    </td>
    <td>
      This class is a <a href="#Multi-Numeric-Types">multi numeric type</a>.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <b>pointer_t</b>
    </td>
    <td>
      This class is a <a href="#Pointer-Type">pointer type</a>.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <b>precompile</b>
    </td>
    <td>
      Do <a href="#Precompiled-Method">precompile</a> all methods in this class, except for accessors, and enumurations. 
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

=end html

If both "public" and "private" are specifed, a compilation error occurs.

If more than one of "callback_t", "mulnum_t", "pointer_t" are specified, a compilation error occurs.

=head2 Destructor

If a L<class|"Class"> can has the destructor.

  method DESTROY : void () {
  
  }

A destructor is a special L<method|"Method"> called when the object is destroyed.

A destructor name must be C<DESTROY>.

A destructor retrun type must be L<void type|"void Type">, otherwise a compilation error occurs.

A destructor must be a L<instance method|"Instance Method"> that don't have the arguments, otherwise a compilation error occurs.

If a L<"Exception"> occurs in the destructor, the exception is not thrown, and prints the message to STDERR.

B<Examples of destructors:>

  class Foo {
    static method new : Foo {
      return new Foo;
    }
  
    method DESTROY : void () {
      print "DESTROY";
    }
  }

=head2 Allow Class Access

By default, private Methods, Fields, and Class Variables cannot be accessed from outside the Class.

Also, Private Class cannot L<"Create Object"> from outside of Class.

If the class allow other class, the other class can access private Methods, Fields, and Class Variables, and can L<"Create Object"> of the class.

  allow CLASS_NAME;

allow must be defined directory under L<"Class Definition">.

  class Foo {
    allow Bar;
  }

In this example, Bar can access the private Method, Field, and Class Variable of Foo can be accessed and can Create Object of Foo.

Specifying the module of B<allow> also loads the module by L<"use"> at the same time.

=head1 Callback

Explains callbacks.

=head2 Callback Definition

A callback can be defined using the L<class descriptor|"Class Descriptors"> C<callback_t>.

  class Comparator: callback_t {
    method : int ($x1 : object, $x2 : object);
  }

The type of the callback is L<"Callback Type">.

A callback must have only one L<method definition|"Method Definition">. The method must be a L<instance method|"Instance Method">.

The callback can't have the L<method block|"Method Block">.

The method name of the callback must be an empty string C<"">.

The callback can't have L<field definitions|"Field Definition"> and L<class variable definition|"Class Variable Definition">.

If the definition of the callback is invalid, a compilation error will occur.

If the object is created by the syntax of L<"Create Callback"> can be assigned to the callback that the types of arguments and return type are same.

  # Create a callback and it is assigned to a callback type
  my $comparator : Comparator = method : int ($x1 : object, $x2 : object) {
    
  };

=head1 Interface

Explains interfaces.

=head2 Interface Definision

A interface is defined using a L<"class descriptor|"Class Descriptors"> C<interface_t>.

  class Asset: interface_t {
    method add_chunk : void ($chunk : string);
    method contains : int ($substring : string);
    method size : int ();
    method is_file : int ();
  }

The type of the interface is L<"Interface Type">.

The object that implements the interface using L<implement stataments|"implement Statement"> can be assign to the interface.

  class Asset::Memory {
    implement Asset;
  }

  class Asset::File {
    implement Asset;
  }
  
  my $asset : Asset = Asset::Memory->new;
  
  my $asset : Asset = Asset::File->new;

=head2 implement Statement

The L<class|"Class"> that implements L<interfaces|"Interface"> is expected to implement the methods of the interface.

  class Asset::Memory {
    implement Asset;

    method add_chunk : void ($chunk : string) {
      # ...
    }
    method contains : int ($substring : string){
      # ...
    }
    method size : int (){
      # ...
    }
    method is_file : int (){
      # ...
    }
  }

  class Asset::File {
    implement Asset;

    method add_chunk : void ($chunk : string){
      # ...
    }
    method contains : int ($substring : string){
      # ...
    }
    method size : int (){
      # ...
    }
    method is_file : int (){
      # ...
    }
  }

Not that C<implement> statement doesn't force the implementation of methods of the interface.

  class Asset::File {
    implement Asset;

    method add_chunk : void ($chunk : string){
      # ...
    }
    method contains : int ($substring : string){
      # ...
    }
    
    # It is OK although size and is_file method is not defined
  }

If the method implementation is not found, an exception is thrown at runtime.

The existence of the method implementation can be checked by the L<has_implement|"has_implement Operator"> operator.

=head1 Module

=head2 Module Summary

Module is a single file that can be read as SPVM source code.

  # lib/path/SPVM/Foo/Bar.spvm
  class Foo::Bar {
  
  }

Module can contain multiple Classes.

  # lib/path/SPVM/Foo/Bar.spvm
  class Foo::Bar {
  
  }
  
  class Foo::Bar::Baz {
  
  }

=head2 Module File Name

Modules must be placed in the module loading path with the following File Name.

Change "::" to "/". Add ".spvm" at the end.

  SPVM/Foo.spvm
  SPVM/Foo/Bar.spvm
  SPVM/Foo/Bar/Baz.spvm

=head2 Load Modules

The C<use> syntax loads a Module.
  
  # Load a module
  use Foo;

If the module does not exist, a compilation error will occur.

Modules are loaded at compile-time.

C<use> syntax must be defined directly under L<"Class Definition">.

  class Foo {
    use Foo;
  }

=head2 Class Alias

C<alias> syntax create an alias name for a class name.
  
  # Create alias
  alias Foo::Bar as FB;

FB is used as Foo::Bar alias in L<class method calls|Class Method Call>.

  # This means Foo::Bar->sum(1, 2);
  FB->sum(1, 2);

C<alias> syntax must be defined directly under L<"Class Definition">.

  class Foo {
    alias Foo::Bar as FB;
  }

You can create an alias at the same time as loading a module by C<use>.
  
  use Foo::Bar as FB;

=head2 Automatically Loaded Module

The followings are Automatically Loaded Modules. They can be used without L<"use">.

<ul>
  <li>Byte</li>
  <li>Short</li>
  <li>Int</li>
  <li>Long</li>
  <li>Float</li>

In SPVM, there is an if require Statement that loads a Module only if it exists in the module path, and if it does not exist, the block does not exist.

It was designed to implement a part of features of "#ifdef" in C language.

  if (require Foo) {
  
  }

if require Statement can be followed by else Statement. 

  if (require Foo) {
  
  }
  else {
  
  }

Note that elsif Statement cannot be followed.

Let's look at an example. if Foo does not exist, no a compilation error occurs and it is assumed that there is no if block

Therefore, "$foo = new Foo;" does not result in a compilation error because it is assumed that there is no if block.

In the other hand, the else block exists, so a warning is issued.

  my $foo : object;
  if (require Foo) {
    $foo = new Foo;
  }
  else {
    warn "Warning: Can't load Foo";
  }

=head1 Class Variable

=head2 Class Variable Definition

B<Class Variable> is a global variable that belongs to L<"Class"> and exists from the start to the end of the program execution.

=head1 Method

=head2 Method Definition

The C<method> keyword defines a class method or an instance method.
  
  # Static method
  static method METHOD_NAME : RETURN_VALUE_TYPE (ARG_NAME1 : ARG_TYPE1, ARG_NAME2 : ARG_TYPE2, ...) {
    
  }

  # Instance method
  method METHOD_NAME : RETURN_VALUE_TYPE (ARG_NAME1 : ARG_TYPE1, ARG_NAME2 : ARG_TYPE2, ...) {
    
  }

Methods must be defined directly under L<"Class Definition">.

Method names must be follow the rule of L<"Method Names">.

The argument names must be follow the rule of L<"Local Variable Names">.

The minimal length of arguments is C<0>. The max length of arguments is C<255>.

The types of the arguments must be L<"Numeric Types">, L<"Multi Numeric Types">, L<"Object Types">, or L<"Reference Type">, otherwise a compilation error occurs.

The type of the return value must be L<"void Type">, L<"Numeric Types">, L<"Multi Numeric Types"> or L<"Object Types">, otherwise a compilation error occurs.

Defined methods can be called using L<"Method Call"> syntax.

A method can have L<method descriptors|"Method Descriptors">.

  DESCRIPTORS static method METHOD_NAME : RETURN_VALUE_TYPE (ARG_NAME1 : ARG_TYPE1, ARG_NAME2 : ARG_TYPE2, ...) {
  
  }

A method has L<"Method Block"> except for the case that the method has the C<native> L<method descriptors|"Method Descriptors">. 

=head3 Variable Length Arguments

C<...> after the type of the argument indicates the argument is a variable length argument. Only the last argument can become a variable length argument.

  static method METHOD_NAME : RETURN_VALUE_TYPE (ARG_NAME1 : ARG_TYPE1, ARG_NAME2 : ARG_TYPE2...) {
  
  }

The type of the variable length argument must be L<"Array Types">.

A variable length argument can recieve multiple values.

  # Definition of variable length argument 
  static method sprintf : string ($format : string, $values : object[]...) {
  
  }
  
  # Pass multiple values to the a variable length argument
  sprintf("Value %d %f", 1, 2.0);

A variable length argument can recieve an array.

  # Pass array to a variable lenght argument
  sprintf("Value  %d %f", [(object)1, 2.0]);

If you want to treat the value as an individual element, cast it to type other than L<"Array Types">..

  sprintf("aaa %p", (object)[(object)1, 2.0]);

=head2 Class Method

A class method is defined with the C<static> keyword.

  static method sum : int ($num1 : int, $num2 : int) {
    # ...
  }

A class method can be called from the L<class name|"Class Names">.
  
  # Call a class method
  my $total = Foo->sum(1, 2);

If the class method is belong to the current class, a class method can be called using L<&|"Current Class"> syntax.
  
  # Call a class method using "&"
  my $total = &sum(1, 2);

=head2 Instance Method

An instance method is defined without the C<static> keyword.

  method add_chunk : void ($chunk : string) {
    # ...
  }

An instance method can be called from the object.
  
  # Call an instance method
  my $asset = Asset->new;
  $asset->add_chumk("foo");

  </tr>
</table>

=end html

=head2 Native Method

Native Method is Method that call function written in Native Language(C, C++, etc).

See <a href="/native-api.html">SPVM Native API</a> Native Method.

=head2 Precompiled Method

If the Class has "precompile" descriptor, the methods of the class become Precompiled Method.

Precompiled Method is translated into C source code and converted into machine code.

The precompiled methods are C code, so you can get performance of C language.

Precompiled Method needs Build Directory described in <a href="/native-api.html">SPVM Native API</a>

=head2 Constant Method

Constant Method is a Method that the return type is L<"Numeric Types"> and returns Constant Value.

  static method foo : int () { return 5; }
  static method foo : long () { return 5L; }
  static method foo : float () { return 5.0f; }
  static method foo : double () { return 5.0; }

Inline Expansion optimization is performed to Constant Method.

Note that SPVM does not perform constant convolution optimization, so if a constant is calculated, it will not performe Inline Expansion.

  # This is not Constant Method.  Inline Expansion is not performed
  static method foo : int () { return 5 + 3; }

=head2 Method

Method is Method that has L<"self Type"> as its first argument.

  method METHOD_NAME : TYPE  (ARGUMENT2 : TYPE2, ARGUMENT3 : TYPE3, ARGUMENTN : TYPEn) {
  
  }

L<"self Type"> must be first argument.

Method can be called from the object created by L<"new">. See L<"Method Call"> for Method Call.

$self is called Invocant.

=head2 Signature

Signature is a string that follow the following rule sequence of Method Retrun Value and arguments arranged according to the following rules. Arguments do not need to exist. There cannot be spaces between them.

1. RETURN_VALUE_TYPE

2. (

3. ARGUMENT_TYPE1,ARGUMENT_TYPE2,ARGUMENT_TYPE3

4. )

It the method is a instance method, the part of signature of the first argument is "self".

B<Examples of Signature:>

  # Method Definition
  static method foo : int ($num1 : double, $num2 : long[])
  
  # Signature
  int(double,long[])
  
  # Method Definition
  static method foo : void ()
  
  # Signature
  void()
  
  
  # Method Definition
  method foo : int ($num1 : double, $num2 : long[])
  
  # Signature
  int(self,double,long[])

Signature is not used in SPVM programs. Signature is used when calling the SPVM Method from <a href="/native-api.html">SPVM Native API</a>.

=head2 Method Callstack

Method Callstack is memory area allocated in each method call.

Method Callstack save the folloing information.

1. Memroy area for L<"Local Variable">

2. The places of Mortal Local Variable

=head1 Enumeration

=head2 Enumeration Definition

Enumeration Definition is a syntax to define multiple L<"Constant Methods"> easily.

  # Enumeration Definition
  enum {
    FLAG1,
    FLAG2,
    FLAG3
  }

Enumeration must be defined directly under L<"Class Definition">.

  class Foo {
    enum {
      FLAG1,
      FLAG2,
      FLAG3
    }
  }

The first value starts with "0". The value is incremented by "1". In this example, "FLAG1" is "0", "FALG2" is "1", and "FLAG3" is "2".

"," can be added after the last element of Enumeration.

  enum {
    FLAG1,
    FLAG2,
    FLAG3,
  }

Enumeration is an alias for L<"Constant Method"> that the return type is L<"int Type">. It is equivalent to the following Method Definition:

  static method FLAG1 : int () { return 0; }
  static method FLAG2 : int () { return 1; }
  static method FLAG3 : int () { return 2; }

The value of L<"int Type"> can be set in the enum element.

  enum {
    FLAG1,
    FLAG2 = 4,
    FLAG3,
  }

In the above case, "FLAG1" is "0", "FALG2" is "4", and "FLAG3" is "5".

If Enum Definition is invalid, a compilation error occurs.

=head2 Enumeration Descriptor

Descriptor can be specified for Enumeration.

  private enum {
    FLAG1,
    FLAG2 = 4,
    FLAG3,
  }

List of Enumeration Descriptor

=begin html

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>
      Descriptor
   </th>
    <th>
      Description
   </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <b>public</b>
    </td>
    <td>
      This Enumeration is public. This Enumeration can be accessed from other Class. This is default setting.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <b>private</b>
    </td>
    <td>
      This Enumeration is private. This Enumeration can not be accessed from other Class.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

=end html

If both "public" and "private" Descriptors are specified, a compilation error occurs.

=head2 Enumeration Call

Enumeration is an alias for L<"Constant Method">, so it can be called in exactly the same way as Method call.

  my $flag1 = Foo->FLAG1;
  my $flag2 = Foo->FLAG2;
  my $flag3 = Foo->FLAG3;

In special case, Enumeration Call can be used in L<"case Statement"> of L<"switch Statement">.

  switch ($num) {
    case Foo->FLAG1: {
  
      break;
    }
    case Foo->FLAG2: {
  
      break:
    }
    case Foo->FLAG3: {
  
      break:
    }
    default: {
  
    }
  }

=head1 INIT Block

B<INIT Block> is a block that is executed immediately after the compilation of program.

INIT Keyword defines INIT Block.

  INIT {
  
  }

INIT Block must be defined directly under L<"Class Definition">.

  class Foo {
    INIT {
  
    }
  }

Zero or more L<"Statements"> can be written in INIT Block.

  INIT {
    my $foo = 1 + 1;
    my $bar;
  }

L<"return Statement"> cannot be written in INIT Block.

Internally, INIT Block is a L<"Method"> that the return type is L<"void Type"> and has no arguments.

You can define multiple INIT Blocks.

The execution order of INIT Block is not guaranteed. If ohter INIT Block is defined in ohter Class, do not assume that INIT Block of the current class will be executed first.

A common use of INIT Block is to initialize L<"Class Variable">.

  class Foo {
    use Point;
    
    our $NUM : int;
    our $POINT : Point;
    INIT {
      $NUM = 3;
      $POINT = Point->new;
    }
  }

=head1 Local Variable

=head2 Local Variable Declaration

B<Local Variable> is a variable that is declared in L<"Scope Blocks">.  Local Variable has L<"Scope">. This is same as Local Variable in C Language.

Local Variable is declared using B<my> L<"Keyword">.

  my LOCAL_VARIABLE_NAME : TYPE;

The local variable name must be follow the rule of L<"Local Variable Names">.

L<"Types"> must be specified. Type must be L<"Numeric Types">, L<"Object Types">, L<"Multi Numeric Types">, or L<"Reference Type">.

  # Local Variable Declaration Examples
  my $var : int;
  my $var : Point;
  my $var : Complex_2d;
  my $var : int*;

Local Variable is initialized by L<"Local Variable Initial Value">.

  # Initialized by 0
  my $num : int;
  
  # Initialized by 0
  my $num : double;
  
  # Initialized by undef
  my $point : Point;
  
  # x is initialized by 0. y is initialized by 0.
  my $z : Complex_2d;

Initialization can be done at the same time as Local Variable Declaration.

  # Initialized by 1
  my $num : int = 1;
  
  # Initialized by 2.5
  my $num : double = 2.5;
  
  # Initialized by Point object
  my $point : Point = new Point;

Using L<"Type Inference">, you omit L<"Types"> in Local Variable Declaration.

  # int
  my $num = 1;
  
  # double
  my $num = 1.0;

Local Variable Declaration returns the value of Local Variable. This is a L<"Expressions">.

  my $ppp = my $bar = 4;
  
  if (my $bar = 1) {
  
  }
  
  while (my $bar = 1) {
  
  }

See L<"Scope"> about Local Variable Scope.

=head2 Local Variable Initial Value

Local Variable is initialized by L<"Type Initial Value">.

=head2 Local Variable Access

Local Variable Access is an operation to access Local Variable to get or set the value.

See L<"Getting Local Variable"> to get Local Variable value.

L<"Setting Local Variable"> to get Local Variable value.

If L<"Class Variable"> with the same name as the Local Variable exists, Program uses the variable as Local Variable, not L<"Class Variable">.

=head1 Scope

=head2 Scope Summary

B<Scope> is a range surrounded by L<"Scope Blocks">.

  # Scope Blocks 
  {
    # Start of Scope
    
    # ...
    
    # End of Scope
  }

Local Variable Declaration registers the Local Variable that is L<"Object Types"> with Mortal Variable in run-time. 

If the object is not L<"undef">, The Reference Count is added by 1.

  {
    # $num become Mortal Variable in run-time
    my $num = new Foo;
  }

At the end of Scope, the object that is registered as Mortal Variable, Reference Count is reduced by 1 except the object is not L<"undef">.

If the reference count become 0, the object released.

=head2 Block

The parts enclosed by C<{> and C<}> are called blocks.

  # Blocks
  {
    1;
  }
  
  if (true) {
    
  }
  
  while (true) {
    
  }
  
  enum {
    ONE,
    TWO,
  }
  
  class Foo {
    
  }

=head2 Scope Blocks

A scope block is the block that create a scope. Zero or more L<statements|"Statements"> can be written in a scope block.

Scope blocks are L<"Simple Block">, L<"Method Block">, L<"eval Block">, L<"if Block">, L<"elsif Block">, L<"else Block">, L<"for Block">, L<"while Block"> and L<"switch Block">.

  }

=head1 String

SPVM has the L<string type|"string Type">. A string is created by L<"String Literal"> L<"String Creation Operator"> or L<"Type Convertion"> to the string type.
  
  # Create a string using a string literal
  my $string = "Hello";
  
  # Create a string using a string creation operator
  my $string = new_string_len 3;
  
  # Create a string using a type conversion to the string type
  my $bytes = [(byte)93, 94, 95];
  my $string = (string)$bytes;

The each charcter can be get using C<-E<gt>[]>.

  # String
  my $string = "Hello";
  my $char0 = $string->[0];
  my $char1 = $string->[1];
  my $char2 = $string->[2];

By default, each character can't be set.
  
  # a compilation error.
  $string_const->[0] = 'd';

If you use C<mutable type qualifier|"mutable Type Qualifier">, each character can be set.

  my $string_mut = (mutable string)$string;
  $string_mut->[0] = 'd';

The created string is one more last byte that value is C<\0> on the internal memory. Although this has no meaning from SPVM language, this has meaning from L<Native APIs|SPVM:Document::NativeAPI>.

The length of the string can be got using a L<string length operator|"String Length Operator">
  
  # Getting the length of the string
  my $message = "Hello"+
  my $length = length $message;

=head1 Undefined Value

An undefined value is represented by C<undef>.

  undef

An undefined value can be assigned to an L<object type|"Object Types">.

In the level of L<native APIs|SPVM:Document::NativeAPI>, C<undef> is defined as C<(void*)NULL>.

  (void*)NULL

An undefined value can be compared by the C<==> operator and the C<!=> operator. An undefined value is guaranteed not to be equal to the any created object.

The type of C<undef> is L<undefined type|"Undefined Type">

B<Examples of undefined values:>
  
  # Undefine values

The Special Assignment Operator is deployed as follows:

  # Before unexpanding
  LEFT_OPERAND SPECIAL_ASSIGNMENT_OPERATOR RIGHT_OPERAND
  
  # After unwinding
  LEFT_OPERAND ASSIGNMENT_OPERATOR (LEFT_OPERAND TYPE CAST)(LEFT_OPERAND SPECIFIC_OPERATOR RIGHT_OPERAND)

For example, for add assignment Operator, it is expanded as follows:

  # Before unexpanding x is L<"byte Type">
  $x += 1;
  
  # After unwinding
  $x = (byte)($x + 1)

B<Special Assignment Operator Example>

Special Assignment Operator Example

  $x += 1;
  $x -= 1;
  $x *= 1;
  $x /= 1;
  $x &= 1;
  $x |= 1;
  $x ^= 1;
  $x %= 1;
  $x <<= 1;
  $x >>= 1;
  $x >>>= 1;
  $x .= "abc";

=head2 Reference Operator

The Reference Operator is an Operator that retrieves the address of a variable for L<"Numeric Types"> or L<"Multi Numeric Types">. Designed to achieve c address Operator "*".

  \VARIABLE

If the variable is not numeric type or Multi Numeric Types, a compilation error occurs

Reference Operator returns expression. The type returned is L<"Reference Type">.

    B<Reference Operator Example>

  my $num : int;
  my $num_ref : int* = \$num;
  
  my $z : Complex_2d;
  my $z_ref : Complex_2d* = \$z;

For a detailed description of Reference, see L<"Reference">.

=head2 Array Length Operator

The array length operator is an L<Unary Operator|"Unary Operators"> to get the length of the array.

  @OPERAND

The operand must be a L<Expression|"Expressions"> that type is an L<"Array Types">, otherwise a compilation error occurs.

The array length operator returns a L<"int Type"> value that is the length of the L<"Array">.

Array Length Operator returns L<"Expressions">

B<Examples of array length operators:>
  
  # Getting the length of the array.
  my $nums = new byte[10];
  my $length = @$nums;

  # Getting the length of the array with a scalar operator. This is exactly same as the avobe
  my $nums = new byte[10];
  my $length = scalar @$nums;
  
Note that SPVM does not have the context different from Perl, and array length operators always return the length of the array.

=head2 String Creation Operator

The string creation operator C<new_string_len> is an L<Unary Operator|"Unary Operators"> to create a L<string|"String"> with the length.

  new_string_len OPERAND

The operand must be an L<expression|"Expressions"> that type is a L<"Integral Type"> except for a L<long type|"long Type">, otherwise a compilation error occurs.

The string creation operator returns the string that is created with the lenght.

The return type is a L<string type|"string Type">.

B<Examples of string creation operators:>
  
  # New a string with the length
  my $message = new_string_len 5;

=head2 copy Operator

The C<copy> operator is an L<Unary Operator|"Unary Operators"> to copy the object.

  copy OPERAND

The operand must be an L<expression|"Expressions"> that type is a L<object type|"object Type">, otherwise a compilation error occurs.

If the type of operand is none of a L<string type|"string Type">, a L<numeric type|"Numerci Types">, a L<multi numeric type|"Multi Numeric Types">,
An L<exception|"Exception"> is thorwn.

The C<copy> operator returns the copied object.

The return type is same as the type of operand.

Read-only flag of the string is dropped.

B<Examples of string creation operators:>
  
  # New a string with the length
  my $message = copy "abc";

=head2 is_read_only Operator

The C<is_read_only> is an L<Unary Operator|"Unary Operators"> to check if the L<string|"String"> is read-only.

  is_read_only OPERAND

The operand must be a L<string type|"string Type">, otherwise a compilation error occurs.

If the string is read-only, the C<is_read_only> operator returns C<1>, otherwise returns C<0>.

The return type is an L<int type|"int Type">.

B<Examples of is_read_only operators:>
  
  # New a string with the length
  my $message = "Hello";
  my $is_read_only = is_read_only $message;

=head2 String Length Operator

The string length operator is an L<Unary Operator|"Unary Operators"> to get the length of the string.

  length OPERAND

The operand must be an L<expression|"Expressions"> that type is a L<"string Type">, otherwise a compilation error occurs.

The string length operator returns a L<"int Type"> value that is the length of the L<"String">.

Note that the returned length is byte size, not the count of the characters of the string that is encoded to a specific character set.

B<Examples of string length operators:>
  
  # Getting the string length. The result is 5
  my $message = "Hello";
  my $length = length $message;
  
  # Getting the string length of UTF-8. The result is 9, not 3
  my $message = "あいう";
  my $length = length $message;

=head2 scalar Operator

The C<scalar> operator is an L<Operator|"Operators"> that returns the value of the operand.

  scalar OPERAND

The operand must be an L<"Array Length Operator">, otherwise a compilation error occurs.

B<Examples of scalar operators:>
  
  # Getting the array length 
  my $nums = new int[3];
  foo(scalar @$nums);

  # This is exactlly same as the above.
  my $nums = new int[3];
  foo(@$nums);

Note that the sclara operator exists only to reduce the confusion.

=head2 isweak Operator

isweak Operator is an Operator that checks whether Field is</a>L<"Weaken Reference.">

  isweak VARIABLE->{FIELD_NAME};

The Type of object Expression must be L<"Class Types">. otherwise a compilation error occurs.

Field names must be a existed field names, otherwise a compilation error occurs.

The Type of the value stored in field must be <a href="#language-type-object">Object Type">, otherwise a compilation error occurs.

If the value stored in field at Run Time is</a> L<"Undefined Value, it returns false. This is <a href="#language-expression">Expression">

isweak Operator returns L<"Expressions">

Operator Precidence can be a top priority by using "()".

  #  a * b is the first
  a * b + c
  
  # b + c is the first
  a * (b + c)

=head2 has_implement Operator

The C<has_implement> operator checks the existence of the method implementation.

The method name must be a L<method name|"Method Names">, otherwise a compilation error occurs.

The return type is L<int type|"int Type">.

If the class of the object has the method implementation, returns C<1>, otherwise returns C<0>.

=head1 Statements

Statements are the parts of syntax that can be written directly under L<"Scope Blocks">.

=head2 empty Statement

An empty statement is a L<statement|"Statements"> that do nothing and ends with just C<;>.

  ;

=head2 expression Statement

The expression statement is a L<statement|"Statements"> that consisting of an L<expression|"Expressions"> and C<;>.

  Expression;

B<Examples of expression statements:>

  1;
  $var;
  1 + 2;
  foo();
  my $num = 1 + 2;

=head2 if Statement

The C<if> statement is a L<statement|"Statements"> for conditional branching.

  if (CONDITION) {
  
  }

The condition L<"Bool Type Conversion"> is executed and Block is executed if the value is non-zero.

If you want to write more than one condition, you can continue with "elsif Statement". The condition determination is performed from above, and each Expression is L<"Bool Type Conversion"> is executed, and a corresponding Block is executed if the value is non-zero.

  if (CONDITON) {
  
  }
  elsif(CONDITION) {
  
  }

You can use C<else> statement to describe what happens if or if the elsif Statement does not meet the criteria. If the if statement and elsif statement condition determination are all false, the statement inside the elseBlock is executed. Elsif Statement does not have to be.

  if (CONDITION) {
  
  }
  elsif (CONDITION) {
  
  }
  else {
  
  }

B<Examples of if statements:>

  # An example of if Statement.
  my $flag = 1;
  
  if ($flag == 1) {
    print "One \ n";
  }
  elsif ($flag == 2) {
    print "Tow \ n";
  }
  else {
    print "Other";
  }

The C<if> Statement is internally surrounded by an invisible Simple Block.

  {
    if (CONDITION) {
  
    }
  }

C<elsif> is internally expanded into C<if> Statement and C<else> Statement.

  #Before deployment
  if (CONDITION1) {
  
  }
  elsif (CONDITION2) {
  
  }
  else {
  
  }
  
  #After deployment
  if (CONDITION1) {
  }
  else {
    if (CONDITION2) {
  
    }
    else {
  
    }
  }

When a variable is declared in the conditional part of if Statement, it must be surrounded by invisible L<"Simple Block">. Be aware that elsif is internally expanded into if Statement and else Statement.

  #Before deployment
  my $num = 1;
  if (my $num = 2) {
  
  }
  elsif (my $num = 3) {
  
  }
  else {
  
  }
  
  #After deployment
  my $num = 1;
  {
    if (my $num = 2) {
  
    }
    else {
      {
        if (my $num = 3) {
          
        }
        else {
          
        }
      }
    }
  }

=head2 switch Statement

The C<switch> statement is a L<statement|"Statements"> for conditional branching with an integer of L<"int Type"> as a condition. Faster than if Statement if the condition is an integer of L<"int Type"> and there are many branches.

  switch (CONDITION) {
    case constant 1: (
  
      break;
    }
    case constant 2: {
  
      break;
    }
    case constant n: {
      break;
    }
    default: {
  
    }
  }

As the condition Expression, L<"Expressions"> can be specified. L<"Bool Type Conversion"> is executed for the condition Expression.

The constants specified in case Statement are L<"byte Type"> or L<"int Type"> constants. must be. For a constant of L<"byte Type">, type conversion to L<"int Type"> at compile time. Will be done. The value of enumType and Constant Method of L<"int Type"> are constants of L<"int Type">. As it is expanded at the time of syntax analysis, it can be used.

The constants specified in the case statement must not overlap. If there are duplicates, a compilation error occurs

If the value specified in the condition Expression matches the value specified in the case statement, jump to the position of that case statement.

If there is no match and a default statement is specified, jump to the default statement position. If no default statement is specified, switch block will not be executed.

A switch statement requires at least one case statement, otherwise a compilation error will occur.

The default Statement is optional.

Only case statement and default statement can be described directly under switch block.

The case and default Blocks can be omitted.

  switch (CONDITION) {
    case constant 1:
    case constant 2:
    {
      break;
    }
    default:
  }

If you use break Statement, you can exit from the switch block.

  switch (CONDITION) {
    case constant 1: (
      break;
    }
    case constant 2: {
      break;
    }
    case constant n: {
      break;
    }
    default: {
  
    }
  }

If a case Block exists, the last Statement must be a break Statement or a returnl Statement, otherwise a compilation error will occur.

B<Examples of switch statements:>

  # switch statements.
  my $code = 2;
  switch ($code) {
    case 1: {
      print "1 \ n";
      break;
    }
    case 2: {
      print "2 \ n";
      break;
    }
    case 3: {
      print "3 \ n";
      break;
    }
    case 4:
    case 5:
    {
      print "4 or 5 \ n"; {
      break;
    }
    default: {
      print "Other \ n";
    }
  }

B<While Statement Example>

An example of a while Statement.

  my $i = 0;
  while ($i <5) {
  
    print "$i \ n";
  
    $i++;
  }

Inside the while block, you can leave the while block by using L<"last Statement">.

  while (1) {
    last;
  }

Inside a while block, you can use L<"next Statement"> to move to the condition immediately before the next condition Expression.

  my $i = 0;
  while ($i <5) {
  
    if ($i == 3) {
      $i++;
      next;
    }
  
    print "$i \ n";
    $i++;
  }

The while Statement is internally enclosed by an invisible L<"Simple Block">.

  {
    while (CONDITION) {
    $i++;
  }
  
  # 展開後
  my $num = 5;
  {
    while (my $num = 3) {
  
      $i++;
    }
  }

=head2 for Statement

The C<for> Statement is a L<statement|"Statements"> for repeating.

  for (INIT_STATEMENT; CONDITION; INCREMENT_STATEMENT) {
  
  }

L<"Expressions"> can be described in the initialization Expression. Generally, write Expression such as initialization of loop variable. Initialization Expression can be omitted.

Condition Expression, L<"Expressions"> can be described. L<"Bool Type Conversion"> is executed for condition Expression, and if the value is not 0, Block is executed. Exit the otherwise block.

L<"Expressions"> can be described in INCREMENT_STATEMENT. Generally, Expression of Increment of loop variable is described. INCREMENT_STATEMENT can be omitted.

for Statement has the same meaning as the following while Statement. INCREMENT_STATEMENT is executed at the end of Block. Initialization Expression is enclosed in L<"Simple Block">.

  {
    INIT_STATEMENT;
    while (CONDITION) {
  
  
      INCREMENT_STATEMENT;
    }
  }

B<Exampels fo for statements:>

  # for statements
  for (my $i = 0; $i <5; $i++) {
  
    print "$i \ n";
  }

Inside the for Block, you can exit the for Block using L<"last Statement">.

  for (INIT_STATEMENT; CONDITION; INCREMENT_STATEMENT) {
  
  }

Inside the for Block, you can use L<"next Statement"> to move immediately before the next INCREMENT_STATEMENT to be executed.

  for (my $i = 0; $i <5; $i++) {
  
    if ($i == 3) {
      next;
    }
  }

=head2 return Statement

See also L<"while Statement">, L<"for Statement">.

=head2 break Statement

The C<break> statement is a L<statement|"Statements"> to move to the outside of the L<switch block|"switch Block">.

  break;

See also L<"switch Statement">.

=head2 warn Statement

The C<warn> statement is a L<statement|"Statements"> to print a warning string to the standard error.

  warn OPERNAD;

The operand must be L<"string Type">.

If the end character of the string is C<\n>, C<warn> statement prints the string itself.

If not, the current file name and current line number are added to the end of the string.

If the value of the operand is an L<undef|"Undefined Value">, print "Warning: something's wrong".

The buffer of the standard error is flushed after the printing.

=head2 die Statement

The C<die> statement is a L<statement|"Statements"> to throw an L<"Exception">.

  die OPERAND;

The operand must be a L<string type|"string Type">, otherwise a compilation error occurs.

The exception thrown by C<die> statement can be cached by an L<eval block|"Exception Catching">
and can be checked by the L<exception variable|"Exception Variable"> C<$@>.

B<Examples of die statements:>
  
  # Catch the exception
  eval {
    # Throw a exception
    die "Error";
  }
  
  # Check the exception
  if ($@) {
    # ...
  }
  
=head2 print Statement

The C<print> statement is a L<statement|"Statements"> to print a L<string|"String"> to the standard output.

  print OPERAND;

The oeprand must be a L<string type|"string Type">.

If the value of the operand is an L<undef|"Undefined Value">, print nothing.

=head2 make_read_only Statement

The C<make_read_only> statement is a L<statement|"Statements"> to make the L<string|"Strings"> read-only.

  make_read_only OPERAND;

The oeprand must be a L<string type|"string Type">.

Read-only strings can't be cast to L<string type|"string Type"> qualified by L<mutable|"mutable Type Qualifier">.

  # A string
  my $string = new_string_len 3;
  
  # Make the string read-only
  make_read_only $string;
  
  # The conversion to the string type qualified by mutable throw an exception.
  my $string_mut = (mutable string)$string;

=head2 weaken Statement

A weaken Statement is a Statement that sets L<"Weaken Reference"> for the Field.

  weaken VARIABLE->{FIELD_NAME};

The Type of the object Expression must be L<"Class Types">, otherwise a compilation error occurs.

Field names must be an existing field names, otherwise a compilation error occurs.

The Type of the value saved in Field must be L<"Object Types">, otherwise a compilation error occurs.

If the value stored in the Field at execution time is L<"Undefined Value">, the weak Statement does nothing.

If the value stored in the Field at runtime is not L<"Undefined Value">, then the following is done:

1. Decrement the reference count of the object stored in Field by 1.

2. Setting the Weaken Reference flag in Field.

3. Add Field to the back reference of the object saved in Field.

Note that the Weaken Reference flag is set on the Field itself, not on the object stored in the Field.

If the reference count of the object saved in Field becomes 0, the Weaken Reference is not created and the object saved in Field is released.

Back Reference is the data of the object saved in Field, and is added to know the Field with the Weaken Reference flag set. There may be more than one.

  # There are multiple back references
  my $foo = new Foo;
  my $bar = new Bar;
  my $baz = new Baz;
  
  $foo->{bar} = $bar;
  $foo->{baz} = $baz;
  
  $bar->{foo} = $foo;
  $baz->{foo} = $foo;
  
  weaken $bar->{foo};
  weaken $baz->{foo};

In the above example, "$bar->{foo}" and "$baz->{foo}" have the Weaken Reference flag set. The object represented by $foo has the back References "$bar->{foo}" and "$baz->{foo}".

The information of the back Reference is necessary because when the L<"Garbage Collection"> is performed, it is necessary to assign the Undefined Value to the Field pointed to by the back Reference.

=head2 unweaken Statement

unweaken Statement is a Statement that cancels L<"Weaken Reference"> for Field.

  unweaken VARIABLE->{FIELD_NAME};

The Type of the object Expression must be L<"Class Types">, otherwise a compilation error occurs.

Field names must be an existing Field names, otherwise a compilation error occurs.

The Type of the value saved in Field must be L<"Object Types">, otherwise a compilation error occurs.

If the value stored in the Field at execution time is L<"Undefined Value">, the unweaken Statement does nothing.

If the value stored in the Field at runtime is not L<"Undefined Value">, then the following is done:

1. Increase the reference count of the object stored in the Field by 1.

2. Clear the Weaken Reference flag of Field.

3. Delete the Field from the back reference of the object stored in the Field.

=head2 Implicit Type Conversion

Implicit type conversion is automatic type conversion performed by SPVM. The following are the places where implicit Type Conversion may occur.

=begin html

<ul>
  <li>When assigning to a different Type</li>
  <li>When passing to Method Arguments of different Type</li>
  <li>When returning a Type different from Return Value</li>
</ul>

=end html

Implicit Type Conversion occurs when:

=head3 Implicit Widening Type Conversion

If both the source and destination Type are Numeric Types and the destination Type is greater than the source Type, L<"Numeric Widening Type Conversion"> is done.

  # Implicit Widening Type Conversion
  my $num : long = 123;
  my $num : double = 12.5f;

=head3 Implicit Narrowing Type Conversion

Both the source and destination Type are Numeric Types, and the destination Type is smaller than the source Type, and the source value can be expressed in the range of Integer Literal and destination Type value. L<"Numeric Narrowing Type Conversion"> is performed.

  # Implicit Narrowing Type Conversion
  my $num : byte = 123;
  my $num : short = 134;

=head3 Implicit Numeric Type to Any Object Conversion

If the source Type is Numeric Types and the destination Type is Any Object Type, L<"Boxing Type Conversion"> to the corresponding Numeric Object Type Is done. In the following case, the converted Int Type object is assigned to the generic object.

  # Implicit Boxing Type Conversion to objectType
  my $num = 123;
  my $object : object = $num;

=head3 Implicit Numeric Type to Numeric Object Type Conversion

When the source Type is Numeric Types and the destination Type is the corresponding Numeric Object Type, L<"Boxing Type Conversion"> to the corresponding Numeric Object Type a> is done.

  # Implicit Boxing Type Conversion to object Type
  my $num = 123;
  my $object : Int = $num;

When the source Type is Any Object Type and the destination Type is Numeric Types, L<"Unboxing Type Conversion"> in the corresponding Numeric Types are displayed. Will be opened. In the following case, an attempt is made to convert the Int Type object to L<"int Type">.

=head3 Implicit Numeric Object Type to Numeric Type Conversion

  # Implicit Unboxing Type Conversion from objectType-
  my $object : object;
  my $num : int = $object;

If the source Type is Numeric Object Type and the destination Type is the corresponding Numeric Types, L<"Unboxing Type Conversion"> in the corresponding Numeric Types Is done.

  # Implicit Unboxing Type Conversion from Numeric Object Type
  my $num_obj = Int->new(3);
  my $num : int = $num_obj;

=head3 Implicit Numeric Type to string Type Conversion

If the source Type is Numeric Types and the destination Type is L<"string Type">, <a href = "#language-type-convertion-numeric-to-string ">Numeric-to-string Type Conversion</a> is performed. In the following case, the numerical value "123" is converted to String "" 123 "" and assigned.

  # Implicit Boxing Type Conversion to string Type
  my $num = 123;
  my $str : string = $num;

=head2 Numeric Types Conversion

Numeric Types Conversion is the conversion from L<"Numeric Types"> to L<"Numeric Types">.

Numeric Types Conversion performs exactly the same processing as Numeric Types Conversion in the corresponding C language. For example, Type Conversion from int to long in SPVM is the same as the type conversion from int32_t Type to int64_t Type in C language.

  # SPVM conversion
  my $src : int = 5;
  my $dist = (long)$src;
  
  # Correspondence in C language
  int32_t src = 5;
  int64_t dist = (int64_t)src;

SPVM has two Numeric Types Convertions.

There are some rules for automatic type conversion of Numeric Types.

=begin html

<ul>
  <li>L<"Unary Numeric Widening Type Conversion"></li>
  <li>L<"Binary Numeric Widening Type Conversion"></li>
</ul>

=end html

Numeric types have an order.

=begin html

<ul>
  <li>L<"Numeric Types Order"></li>
</ul>

=end html

=head2 Numeric Types Order

L<"Numeric Types"> has the order of Type. The order of Type is "byte", "short", "int", "long", "float", "double" from the smallest.

=head2 Unary Numeric Widening Type Conversion

Unary Numeric Widening Type Conversion means that L<"Expressions"> is L<"byte Type"> or short Type. In this case, perform L<"Numeric Widening Type Conversion"> to L<"int Type"> I say that.

Unary Numeric Widening Type Conversion is performed in the following cases.

=begin html

<ul>
  <li>Array Index</li>
  <li>Dimension when creating Array</li>
  <li>Unary Plus Operator operands</li>
  <li>Unary Minus Operator operands</li>
  <li>Left and the right operands of Shift Operator "<<" ">>" ">>>"</li>
</ul>

=end html

=head2 Binary Numeric Widening Type Conversion

Binary Numeric Widening Type Conversion is performed to the left operand and the right operand in Binary Operator that takes Numeric Types on the Left and Right sides. L<"Numeric Widening Type Conversion">.

The following rules apply.

1. When one Expression is L<"double Type">, the other Type is L<"double Type"> Is converted to>.

2. If one Expression is L<"float Type">, the other Type is L<"float Type"> Is converted to>.

3. When one Expression is L<"long Type">, the other Type is L<"long Type"> Is converted to>.

4, otherwise, it will be converted to L<"int Type">.

Binary Numeric Widening Type Conversion is performed in the following cases.

=head2 Numeric Narrowing Type Conversion

Numeric Narrowing Type Conversion is a conversion rule applied when converting from a large type to a small type in L<"Numeric Types">.

=head2 Numeric Widening Type Conversion

Numeric Widening Type Conversion is a conversion rule applied when converting from a small type to a large type in L<"Numeric Types">.

=head2 Numeric to string Type Conversion

The numerci to string type conversion is a L<type conversion|"Type Conversions"> from a L<numeric type|"Numeric Types"> to a L<string type|"string Type"">.

  # Numeric to string type conversion
  my $byte = (byte)1;
  my $short = (short)2;
  my $int = 3;
  my $long = 4L;
  my $float = 2.5f;
  my $double = 3.3;
  
  # The string is "1".
  my $string_byte = (string)$byte;
  
  # The string is "2".
  my $string_short = (string)$short;

  # The string is "3".
  my $string_int = (string)$int;

  # The string is "4".
  my $string_long = (string)$long;
  
  # The string is "2.5"
  my $string_float = (string)$float;
  
  # The string is "3.3"
  my $string_double = (string)$double;

=head2 string to byte[] Type Conversion

string to byte[] type conversion is a L<"Type Conversions"> from L<"string Type"> to L<"byte[] Type">.

  # string to byte[] Type Conversion
  my $string : string = "Hello";
  my $bytes : byte[] = (byte[])$string;

A new byte[] object is created and all characters in the string are copied to the elements of byte[] object.

=head2 byte[] to string Type Conversion

byte[] to string type conversion is a L<"Type Conversions"> from L<"byte[] type"> to L<"string Type">.

  # byte[] to string type conversion
  my $bytes : byte[] = new byte[3];
  $bytes->[0] = 'a';
  $bytes->[1] = 'b';
  $bytes->[2] = 'c';
  my $string : string = (string)$bytes;

A new string is created and all elements in the byte[] object are copied to the characters of the string.

=head2 Boxing Type Conversion

Boxing Type Conversion is the operation to convert the value of Numeric Types to Numeric Object Type.

=head2 Unboxing Type Conversion

Unboxing Type Conversion is an operation to convert the value of Numeric Object Type to the corresponding value of Numeric Types.

=head2 Bool Type Conversion

Bool Type Conversion is a conversion applied in the conditional part of if Statement, etc. for True/False Value judgment.

B<Where Bool Type Conversion takes place>

B<Inside the if statement braces>

  if (CONDITION) {
  
  }

B<In unless statement brackets>

  unless (CONDITION) {
  
  }

B<The second in the parentheses for>

  for (INITIALIZEATION;CONDITION;NEXT_VALUE;) {
  
  }

B<in parentheses while>

  while (CONDITION) {
  
  }

B<Left and Right of Logical AND Operator>

  CONDITION && CONDITION

B<Left and Right of Logical OR Operator>

  CONDITION || CONDITION

B<Right side of Logical NOT Operator>

  !CONDITION

Expression specified by Bool Type Conversion is L<"Numeric Types"> or L<"Object Types"> or It must be L<"Undefined Type">, otherwise a compilation error occurs.

Return Value of Bool Type Conversion is Expression of L<"int Type">.

If Expression is L<"Undefined Value">, 0 is returned.

If Expression is Bool->FALSE, 0 is returned. This is special case of the object of Bool class. false keywords means Bool->FALSE.

If Expression is Bool->TRUE, 1 is returned.  This is special case of the object of Bool class. true keywords means Bool->TRUE.

When Expression is L<"Numeric Types">, L<"Unary Numeric Widening Type Conversion"> is done.

If Expression is L<"int Type">, that value is returned.

Expression is L<"long Type">, L<"float Type">, <a href = "#language- If it is type-double ">double Type</a>, Object Type, the operation that exactly same as the following operation in C language is performed and the result is returned.

  !!x

If Expression is Object Type, 0 is returned if it is Undefined Value, 1 otherwise.

B<Bool Type Conversion Examples>

  if (1) {
    # run
  }
  
  if (0) {
    # not run
  }
  
  if (1.5) {
    # run
  }
  
  if (0.0) {
    # not run
  }
  
  if (true) {
    # run
  }
  
  if (Bool->TRUE) {
    # run
  }
  
  if (false) {
    # not run
  }
  
  if (Bool->FALSE) {
    # not run
  }
  
  my $object = SPVM::Int->new(1);
  
  if ($object) {
    # run
  }
  
  if (undef) {
    # not run
  }

=head1 Type Qualifiers

Type qualifiers qualify the type.

  QUALIFIER TYPE

=head2 mutable Type Qualifier

The C<mutable> type qualifier is used to allow to set the character of the string.

  my $string : mutable string;

B<Examples:>
  
  # Mutable string
  my $message = (mutable string)"abc";
  $message->[0] = 'd';

=head1 Exception

=head2 Exception overview

SPVM has a mechanism of Exception. Exception consists of raising L<"Exception"> and catching the exception.

=head2 Throw Exception

Use L<"die Statement"> to throw L<"Exception">.

  die EXPRESSION;

When the die statement is executed, the stack trace and the String specified by Expression are displayed, and the program ends. The stack trace includes class names, Method names, File Name and line number. File Name is a relative File Name from the path where Module is loaded.

  Error
  from TestCase::Minimal->sum2 at SPVM/TestCase/Minimal.spvm line 1640
  from TestCase->main at SPVM/TestCase.spvm line 1198

=head2 Exception Catching

Exception catching is a function that can stop the program from ending and get an error message when L<"Exception"> is thrown.

Exceptions are caught using eval Block Statement. Please note that the eval Block Statement requires a semicolon at the end.

  eval {
    # Processing that may throw L<"Exception">
  };

When L<"Exception"> is caught by the eval Block, the program termination is stopped and L<"is added to <a href="#language-exception-var">Exception Variable">. The message specified in Exception is thrown</a> is methodstituted.

=head2 Exception Variable

B<Exception Variable> is a global variable that is represented by "B<$@>"

  $@

See L<"Setting Class Variable"> to get Exception Variable Value.

See L<"Setting Exception Variable"> to set Exception Variable Value.

=head1 Garbage Collection

The object is released from memory when the reference count reaches 0.

If the object is an Array that has Object Type values ​​as elements, the reference count of all Array elements that are not Undefined Value is decremented by 1 before Garbage Collection

When an object is a Class Types and has a field of Object Type, the reference count of the objects owned by all Fields of Object Type that are not Undefined Value is decremented by 1 before Garbage Collection. If Weaken Reference is set to the object saved in Field, Weaken Reference is released before Reference Count is decremented by 1.

When the object has Back references of Weaken Reference, Undefined Value is assigned to all Fields registered as back References and all back References are deleted.

The above process is done recursively.

=head2 Create Callback

Create Callback is a Syntax that creates an object that conforms to Callback Type by using a special syntax for the purpose of Callback.

  method : TYPE_NAME  (ARGS1 : TYPE1, ARGS2 : TYPE2, ARGSN : TYPEn) {
  
  }

When Create Callback is performed, L<"Class Definition"> is performed internally, an object based on that Class is generated, and <a href = " Returned as # language-expression ">Expression</a>. It is possible to assign to a variable like the following.

  my $cb_obj = method : TYPE (ARGS1 : TYPE1, ARGS2 : TYPE2, ..., ARGSn : TYPEn) {
  
  };

Method defined by Create Callback must be L<"Method">. It must also be a Method with no name.

B<Create Callback Example>

  my $comparator = method : int ($x1 : object, $x2 : object) {
  
  }

You can call Method because the object created by Create Callback is a normal object. For the call to Create Callback, see L<"Method Call">.

=head2 Capture

In Create Callback, you can use the syntax called Capture to use the variables defined outside the method defined by Create Callback inside the method defined by Create Callback.

  # Capture
  [VariableName1 : Type1, VariableName2 : Type2] method MethodNames : int ($x1 : object, $x2 : object) {
  
  };

Capture Example.

  my $foo = 1;
  my $bar = 5L;
  
  my $comparator = [$foo : int, $bar : long] method : int ($x1 : object, $x2 : object) {
  
    print "$foo\n";
    print "$bar\n";
  }

The variable name used in Capture must be the one with "$" added at the beginning of L<"Field Names">.

The Capture is actually defined as a field of Class. Capture is a field definition and value setting syntax sugar.

If L<"Local Variable"> with the same name as the Capture variable exists in the Scope, access the Local Variable.

If there is a L<"Class Variable"> with the same name as the Capture variable, access the Capture variable.

If you write Create Callback and Capture without using syntax sugar, it will be as follows.

  class ComapartorImpl {
    has foo : int;
    has bar : long;
  
    method : int ($x1 : object, $x2 : object) {
      print $self->{foo} . "\n";
      print $self->{bar} . "\n";
    }
  }

  my $foo = 1;
  my $bar = 5L;
  
  my $comparator = new ComparatorImpl;
  
  $comparator->{foo} = $foo;
  $comparator->{bar} = $bar;

Capture is a syntax for writing such a long description short.

=head1 Weaken Reference

Weaken Reference is a reference that does not increase the reference count. Weaken Reference can be used to solve the problem of circular references.

SPVM has GC of Reference Count Type. In the GC of Reference Count Type, the object is automatically released when the reference count becomes 0, but when the circular reference occurs, the reference count does not become 0 and the object is automatically released. not.

This is an Example when the Field of the object is circularly referenced.

  {
    my $foo = new Foo;
    my $bar = new Bar;
  
    $foo->{bar} = $bar;
    $bar->{foo} = $foo;
  }

In this case, both objects are not released when the Scope ends. This is because a circular reference has occurred and the reference count does not become 0.

Weaken Reference is a function to correctly destroy objects when a circular reference occurs in a programming language that has a Reference Count GC.

In such a case, it is possible to release correctly by setting one Field to Weaken Reference using L<"weaken Statement">.

  {
    my $foo = new Foo;
    my $bar = new Bar;
  
    $foo->{bar} = $bar;
    $bar->{foo} = $foo;
  
    weaken $foo->{bar};
  }

Before the weaken statement is executed, $foo has a Reference Count of 2 and $bar has a Reference Count of 2.

If there is no weaken statement, the reference count of $foo and the reference count of $bar will not be 0 and will not be released even if the scope ends.

When a weaken statement is executed, $foo has a Reference Count of 2 and $bar has a Reference Count of 1.

When the Scope ends, the reference count of $bar is decremented by 1 and becomes 0, so it is released correctly.

Even if there are 3 circular references, you can release them correctly by setting Weaken Reference in 1 Field.

  {
    my $foo = new Foo;
    my $bar = new Bar;
    my $baz = new Baz;
  
    $foo->{bar} = $bar;
    $bar->{baz} = $baz;
    $baz->{foo} = $foo;
  
    weaken $foo->{bar};
  }

As a syntax related to Weaken Reference, Weaken Reference can be released L<"weaken Statement">, and it can be confirmed whether Field is Weaken Reference <a href = "#language- There is an operator-isweak ">isweak Operator</a>.

=head1 Default Loaded Modules

SPVM loads the following modules just after the program start. These modules are deeply relataed to SPVM language, such as L<type conversions|"Type Conversions">.
