=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<SPVM::Comparator::Object> is a callback type to compare objects.

=head1 CALLBACK METHOD

  sub : int ($self : self, $obj1 : object, $obj2 : object);

This method should receive two objects and return 1 if $obj1 is more than $obj2, -1 if $x is lass than $obj2, 0 if $obj1 equals $obj2 in the implementation.
