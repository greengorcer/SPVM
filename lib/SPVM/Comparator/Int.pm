=head1 SYNOPSYS
  
  use Comparator::Int;
  
  my $comparator : Comparator::Int = method : int ($a : int, $b : int); {
    return $a <=> $b;
  };
  
  my $result = $comparator->(3, 5);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Comparator::Int|SPVM::Comparator::Int> is a callback type to compare two int values.

=head1 CALLBACK METHOD
